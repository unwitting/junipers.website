# Juniper's website

Welcome to my website!

This is a little space I made to gather and share the things that bring me joy, the throwaway thoughts and rabbit-holes of research I end up down. It is likely of no practical use to you whatsoever.

Day-to-day, I'm a software engineer working on [Valla](https://valla.uk/), an online tool to help you collect evidence and produce the documents you'd need to take your employer to tribunal and self-represent.

Outside of that, I love a great many things and pick up lots of hobbies. I find that often the best way for me to learn is to write down what I find out, so that's largely what I put here: bits of music theory, facts I pick up, how bits of electronics work, anything really.

Have a browse if you like.
