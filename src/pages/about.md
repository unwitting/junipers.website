# About me

Hello, my name's Juniper. I use she / they pronouns. I live by the sea in Edinburgh, Scotland.

I'm a software engineer! I've been in this job for a pretty long time now and I've worked on a [lot of different things](https://www.linkedin.com/in/juniperpreston/): the code that handles geometry in CAD software, the mobile web interface for a dating app, Skyscanner's SEO pages and more recently full stack health and care technology. Right now I help to build [Valla](https://valla.uk), a platform helping people resolve their employment grievances.

Outside of work, I love to make cute (mostly queer) designs and turn them into stickers and other things. I sell them through my Etsy store, [MermaidMixup](https://etsy.com/shop/mermaidmixup). Follow along on Instagram at [@mermaidmixup](https://instagram.com/mermaidmixup). I also swim (mostly in the sea), play a lot of [chess](https://www.chess.com/member/unwttng) and am learning to sew.

If you'd like to follow me on social media, I'm [@unwttng](https://twitter.com/unwttng) on Twitter.
